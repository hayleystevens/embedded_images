# Embedded Image
## The goal of this extension is to embedded images within a Tableau dashboard without using custom shapes.  

There are a few issues adding images through custom shapes. 
  * Using Custom shapes to add images drastically decreases the image quality. 
  * The number of elements in the workbook must match the number of elements in the shape palette. If the number of elements in the workbook is greater than the number of elements in the shape palette, the shapes will not match up to the appropriate element. This becomes an larger issue when there are 100+ shapes.
  * Whenever a new image is added, the image must be added to \My Tableau Repository\Shapes and the Shapes palette must be refreshed.
